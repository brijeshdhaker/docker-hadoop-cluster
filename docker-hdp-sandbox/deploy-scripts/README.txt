######################### HOW TO USE ##########################

1) AS ROOT first run either install-hdp.sh or install-hdf.sh if no sandbox is present. 
   Note: If you already have a sandbox running skip this step. Same goes for if you downloaded one of the pre-packaged sandbox virtualmachines
2) AS ROOT run enable-cda.sh to enable CDA
   Note: You must adjust your hosts file manually and add both 'sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com' and 'sandbox-hdf.hortonworks.com' to your hosts file
